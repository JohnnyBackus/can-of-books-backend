## Overview

This site is the result of a collaborative student project by CodeFellows Coding Program out of Seattle, WA.The purpose is to demonstrate the ability to work in pairs and quickly deploy a full stack app. The front-end utilized a React Framework with Bootstrap Components. The server was built with NodeJS and our database was MongoDB. Other dependencies included express, axios, cors, dotenv, and mongoose.

For this application books were used as our sample resource. REST principles allow the visitor to access and manipulate book data through four methods - Create, Read, Update, and Delete also known as CRUD. The user can add a book to the database, view all books in the database, update a book in the database, and delete a book from the database. The user can also view a list of books that they have added to the database.

## Getting Started

Starting this project first required a work agreement among the students.

## Architecture

REST Architecture implementing CRUD principles. Tools used include REACT, JavaScript, APIs, Axios, MONGODB, Express, Axios, Cors, BootStrap , and Mongoose.
